# My Modern Blog 🚀

A clean, responsive, static blog / portfolio website — built with HTML, CSS (and optional JS) — designed to showcase blog posts, images, PDFs and general content, version-controlled with Git and hosted on GitHub.

## 🔍 Overview

- Mobile-friendly and responsive layout — works on desktop as well as small-screen devices.  
- Easy to maintain: add/edit/delete files locally and push to GitHub; the site will reflect those changes.  
- Version control ensures all changes and history are tracked, which makes collaboration, rollback or content management simple.
